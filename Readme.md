it's working but not always, first, try to find the why then, provide a solution, to help you, when refresh it's not working when going up, also at init we want to color the first tile of the owl, which is the tile in the center, a third request is that, we're coloring the tile in a gradient manner, and the tile should be colored totally once we finish the transition, also, obviously we don't want to change the color when we trying to go outside of the grid; for example, I'm on the top right and I try to go up, I cannot, right now, it's changing the color of the tile but we dont want that
